Just a place for me to put my Advent of Code 2023 solutions.

To run, make sure you have Deno installed and then run

```
$ deno task run 01-1
# ...or whatever day + part you want to run
```

Outputs are written to stdout and the `output` directory.

There is also `deno task bench` which will run all the solutions as benchmarks, for some reason.
